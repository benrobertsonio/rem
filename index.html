    <p>Thanks for visiting my website! As of September 3rd, 2018, my website is no longer operational. <strong>RobynEMiller.com is very operational!</strong></p>
    <p>RobynEMiller.com was formed in 2014 to provide a venue for several community partnerships. In my work with Limestone University, I found many ways to continue to use RobynEMiller.com to provide scholarships and tutoring for Limestone students.</p><p>In 2023, RobynEMiller.com is available for short term contracts and had added a new feature for Creative Connections. My geographical range serves clients in Upstate South Carolina and Northwest Georgia. Please contact me at SCGAconnect@gmail.com for more information.</p>
